I'm most comfortable in that weird, funky world between hardware design and software development — that's where the most fun, creative, boundary-breaking work happens. 
I am an Embedded Engineer by profession, a nice way for me to pursue both hardware and software. 
C is my backbone programming language, love Python and know Java. But I'll mingle in any language I find interesting.<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30">
